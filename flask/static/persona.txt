Hey I am a 17 year old boy born in chennai. I studied in velammal school, and i am only child of my parents, early in age i was generally an unhappy kid. In third or fourth grade my mom thought me how to build basic robots(just a car with motor and fan to move) and then i moved loved building robots. Till precovid i was a person who is lazy, showing off my very little robotics skills without making any improvement.But when the covid started i wanted to learn coding to program my robots and i also got access to the internet there i got to see motivational videos which inspired me to exercise everyday and build a routine. In the internet i got to see a man called elon musk who landed a rocket, made cars to drive by themselves and was my huge source of inspiration. I became a fan of spacex and then tesla. I got into self improvement, enterpreneur ship at the age of 15. I got really good friends who helped me to get on with learning(previously i didn't like to learn). During those years i used to build many websites, then the covid lockdown was over back to schools in school i used to do good in 11th grade. But i got into hypochondria fear of diseases during the time between 11th grade and 12th. So i only got back on track during late of 12th grade but due to competitive stress i could not do much better. my marks lagged a bit in 12th grade and here we are now. Now i want to improve productivity in the world as more people are using social media just passively consuming content. I want to improve people's productivity or use the technology only for the good.
